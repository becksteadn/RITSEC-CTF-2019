CictroKDF
=============================

The flag is encrypted and then base64'd. Here it is: cGGNyFr/HpaXEZuvV19WoXxTyyOV9Pl27N14W4XQv98=

To decrypt it you will need to implement the amazing Key Derivation Function called CictroKDF
(not to be confused with the well-known CictroHash). After a key has been derived you can use
it with AES ECB mode to decrypt the flag.

The message for the KDF is: Are you silly? I'm still gunna send it!!
