These files are ripped from NASA's soundcloud, the files then each have a single
character encoded on them.  They are encoded using binary (ASCII) with a
modification for each bit.  If the section modified has spike(s) overwritten
in the original file it is a 1, otherwise it is a 0.  These spell out the flag:
